# MEAN Human Resources application #

It's acutally really nice, I promise...

This project is the result of reading the _Full Stack JavaScript Development with MEAN_ book.
It makes use of (M)ongoDB, (E)xpress, (A)ngular, and (N)ode.js as it's application stack, although my personal preference might eventually turn (A)ngular into (E)mber for a MEEN stack.

This repository will only be usefull to you if you are stuck in the book and are looking for an example.
It might also be helpful if you are trying to figure out my development capabilities, but given that this is a book based tutorial project, I wouldn't put too much stock into it.
